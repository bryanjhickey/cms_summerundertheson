				<p>In 1 Peter 2:11 the King James Version describes believers as "strangers and pilgrims". Although our earthly home may be Australia, the Bible calls us to live a different lifestyle to most Aussies. And the more we follow that command, the more we are, indeed, strangers to the world around us.</p>
				<p>As CMS sends missionaries to cross cultures with the Gospel, to places that are not their home, so too our home as Christians really isn't here on earth, but in heaven. Whatever our role in the partnership of mission, we are called to live out Jesus' love and life here on earth as strangers until we are ready to return to our heavenly home. </p>

				<h2>Glen Davies</h2>
				<p>Glenn Davies, Archbishop of Sydney, leads our morning Bible studies in 1 Peter.</p>

				<h2>Greg Anderson</h2>
				<p>Greg Anderson is Bishop of the Northern Territory.</p>
				<p>His first experience of the Territory was in 1986, researching into the traditional songs of central Arnhem Land. Adopted into a Rembarrnga clan, he worked with musicians who had become Christian through the Elcho Island revival of 1979. It was these contacts that prompted a desire to study theology, and Greg, now married with a family, returned to the Territory in 1995. For the next 12 years they lived at Numbulwar, working with CMS training church leaders at Nungalinya College and with the Diocese of the Northern Territory. In 2007 Greg became head of the Department of Mission at Moore Theological College, Sydney, where he served until his consecration as Bishop of the Northern Territory in 2014.</p>
